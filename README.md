# 💡 **Problem Statement**

Currently the presiding social medias available on web2 market are centralised and have huge censorship power. We aim to drop the power from the hands of few to the hands of the people

# 💪 Goals

- Use Twitt3r to create a safe cyberplace for one using DID

# 🧠 Knowledge Primer

- [DataverseOS SDK](https://gitbook.dataverse-os.com/) is a software development kit that provides multiple features to developers that includes stream creation, wallet connection etc

# 💻 Tech Stack

- React.js
- TailwindCSS
- DataverseOS
- Flutter 

# ⏭️ What's next

- Immersive experiences:It's time we see and engage with the world differently. Right now, we experience augmented reality through games, but there's a lot to it more than entertainment.
- Support multiple media options: Add support for media like 3d models, VR/AR based posts etc.
- Encryption: Add additional encryption which allows only people who bought a particular asset of the user can access 

#   Challenges we ran into

- Working with DataverseOS was challenging for us due to less number of resources available but we managed to work around with what we had
- Stream creation and then monetizing it was also a bit difficult
